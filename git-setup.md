# Working with a Git Remote

This markdown file contains a brief tutorial for how to use the basic git
features that will make this semester easier for you.  This is based on the [CSCI 441
Lab
tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/msu-cs/csci-441-spring2020/src/master/labs/README.md).

## 1. Sign up for Github

First, you'll need a GitHub account, so [sign up
here](https://github.com/join).

## 2. Install Git

Now, we need to make sure git is installed on your computer. There are a number of git GUI
clients, including
[SourceTree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview), or
[others](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).  I'll leave you to figure out your
GUI of choice on your own if you like.  I always stick to the command line when
I can, so that's what I'll be showing you how to do. In a terminal run the
following:

    git --version

If you get an error you may need to [download and install
git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).  If you've never used git before you might
want to [read up on the docs](http://git-scm.com/doc), or go through the basics
with [Try Git](try.github.com).

## 3. Setup SSH Keys

If you really like typing, you can connect to GitHub using HTTPs access.
However, I suggest using SSH.  [See instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
)

## 4. Clone the course repository

To clone the repository, type the following in your command line:

    git clone git@github.com:msu/csci-246-spring2021.git 


## 5. Duplicate the Repository

Forks in git are public by default.  You can use a fork if you'd like, but I
will suggest duplicating the repository to a private git repository.  See the
following link for details:
[Directions
Here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)

## 6. Clone your repository

To download your repository so it's ready for modifications, we need to clone
it.  Run the following command with <repo url> replaced with the url to your
private repository (you can find this by clicking the Code button in GitHub).

    git clone <repo url>

## 7. How to pull the latest assignments

I'll be adding assignments here throughout the semester so you'll need to add
this repository as a remote that you can pull changes from. Make sure you cd
into your repository, something like (depending on what you named it):

    cd csci-246-spring2021

Then let's list what remotes we currently have:

    git remote -v

You should see two entries for your Bitbucket repository, one (fetch) and one
(push). When you use `git push` or `git pull`, by default you'll push or pull
to/from that url. We want to add another entry that we can explicitly pull from
to merge in assignments as I add them. To do that, run the following:

    git remote add csci246 https://github.com/msu/csci-246-spring2021

Now if you run the `git remote -v` command you'll see two additional entries.
You won't have permission to push to this one, but you will be able to pull new
assignments by running the following:

    git pull csci246 master

For more information and troubleshooting, [see
here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/adding-a-remote).

## 8. How To Save Your Work

Once you start making changes to your code, you'll want to commit those changes
and push them back up to Bitbucket. You should do this often to keep a good
history of what changes you made and why. It also ensures your files are safely
stored on the server.

For every file you've changed or created, you'll want to run `git add <file
name>`. The command stages the file for commit. You can think of staging a file
as flagging that you want to save it in your next commit. Once you've staged
every file that you want to commit type:

    git commit -m "A short description of what you're committing"

It can be handy to see what files have been changed. To see what changes have
been made you can use `git status`. `git status` will show you which files
you've modified, which files are new and which files have been staged for
commit.

When working in a group, writing good commit messages are very important.  Your
collaborators (including your future self) will be very thankful for well crafted
messages.  For more on how to write good commit messages, see blogs from
[erlang project](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages),
[Tim Pope](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
or, [Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Sometimes, git can be a little finicky if you have trailing white space in the
file. Often, your text editor or IDE has an option (or plugin) to automatically
trim trailing white space. It is a good idea to enable automatic trimming of
trailing white space as it can save your some headaches in the future.

Be careful to not commit files that are generated by the build process
(i.e. .bbl, .pdf, and .aux files).  I've included a
.gitignore file in the repository that will ignore most files that will be
generated by your LaTexbuild processes, but others may be generated as well that I'm
not aware of (especially if you're running your code on Windows or MacOS).

You can commit as many times as you want locally. When you're ready to submit
all your commits up to the server (so they are safe if you throw your computer
out the windoe), run:

    git push origin master

If you've cloned your repository in more than one location (such as on a lab
computer and on your own laptop) and have made changes to one of them and pushed
those changes up to the server, you can use `git pull` from the other location
to bring it up to date.

## 9. More Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). When you cloned the
repository above, you downloaded every change that has ever been made to the
repository. You can see each individual change by running the following:

    git log

You'll see a list of commits, which are changes to a set of files in your
repository. Each commit looks something like this (this is the first commit to
your repository, made by me):

    commit fd550eaab023eef5deb3f00aa2265d3dbbd5c5ed
    Author: David Millman <david.millman@montana.edu>
    Date:   Thu Jan 4 20:05:31 2018 -0700

        Add initial version of syllabus

The first line shows the hash value for the commit. If you ever want to revert
back to a specific commit you can use `git checkout <hash value>`. In your
repository, you can type the following to get to the very first change ever
made:

    git checkout fd550eaab023eef5deb3f00aa2265d3dbbd5c5ed

To get back to the lastest, you can run:

    git checkout master
