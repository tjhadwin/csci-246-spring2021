# Miscellaneous Assignments

Throughout this semester, you will have the opportunity to attend various seminars or events, and write a brief reflection on them for credit in the miscellaneous category. These reflections should be written as a formal two-page paper. In general, you may consider the following questions when writing your reflection, but there are no specific formatting requirements (unless otherwise stated):

* What did you learn?
* What is a piece of advise that you took away?
* Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?
* Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?
* If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?
* Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what was it?
* Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee / collaborator in the future?
* What is your take-away message from this event?
* How did the contents of this event relate to our class? (Even if not explicitly discussed).

## Without Specific Dates

Each of the following assingments is due one week after the event.  You can make
one submission per category.  (Note that these assignments show a due date of
Monday, 26 April 2021 since the actual event that you attend is not fixed).

1. Attend one of the CS seminars. They are held Mondays 16:10-17:00.  Please
   join cs-announce the notification of who is speaking each week (and the WebEx
   link).
2. Attend a writing workshop.  They are held on Fridays, 9:00-10:00 (please see
   discord for the link, or ask Prof. Fasy).  When you join, please bring a
   short writing sample (something that can be read in 5-10 minutes).  A great
   example of something to bring is the write-up of one of your homework
   problems.  (Of course, if you bring your HW, you should note the
   collaborators in the header of the HW itself). We use breakout rooms to break
   into groups of size 2-3, spend some time reading our partner's writing
   sample, then some time giving feedback to each other.  In the end, we come
   back as a group and discuss any themes that emerged.  To earn miscellaneous
   credit, you should make the suggested edits to your writing sample and submit
   the original version, submitted version, and a one-half to one-page write-up
   explaining what you learned about technical writing from this experience.
3. Complete a virtual escape room.  In your two-page write-up, explain how you solved at
   least one of the problems, and note the connections to things that we have
   learned in this class.  Be sure to include your team photo in the submission!
4. Learn about a faculty member at MSU.  Choose a faculty member at MSU (can be
   from any department), and write a two-page summary about their research area.
   Be sure to cite at least one of their papers or books.
5. Complete three inductive proofs from the following list, including at least
   one of the starred problems:

6. The course website might have typos.  If you see one, fix it and issue a pull
   request (PR). [More about
   PRs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)
7. Do something for yourself. Make an appointment with a wellness coach, try a
   new (online) exercise class, try going to bed earlier for a week, etc. Write
   a one-page reflection on whatever it is you did. What
   impact that that have on your ability to focus?  Do you have any additional
   short-term goals that you can set for your future self?

## With Specific Dates

The due dates for these assignments is one week after the event.

C. 246 Writing workshop on 3/4. When you join, please bring a short writing
sample (something that can be read in 5-10 minutes).  This can be either a proof
in H-4, something that you handed into a previous HW, or something else
entirely. (Of course, if you bring your HW, you should note the collaborators in
the header of the HW itself, including those who gave you feedback on the
write-up). I'll start with some general tips, then we will use breakout rooms to
break into small groups, spend some time reading our partner's writing
sample, then some time giving feedback to each other.  In the end, we come back
as a group and discuss any themes that emerged.  To earn miscellaneous credit,
you should make the suggested edits to your writing sample and submit the
original version, submitted version, and a one-half to one-page write-up
explaining what you learned about technical writing from this experience.

D. CS Wellness Workshop.  Wednesday, 10 March at 16:30.  Write a 1-2 page
reflection on this event. Make the reflection your own, and only share what you

Did you learn something new?  What do you already do that is working well for
your health and well-being? Do you have any wellness goals?
